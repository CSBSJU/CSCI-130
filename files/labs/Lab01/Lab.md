## Objectives

* to map network drives
* to use email to submit documents
* to schedule meetings using Microsoft Outlook
* to have an experience programming robots

## Preliminaries
For this course, you will be using the campus-wide network of PC’s. As part of
your computer account privileges, you are given disk storage space on drive
`M`, a networked hard disk. As a student of CSCI-130, you also have read only
privileges on drive `N`. Write-ups for your labs, handouts and example files or
programs will be placed on the `N:` drive for you to access. Please follow the
steps outlined below to gain access to the `N:` drive and to get organized
properly for this and following labs.

## Creating your `M:\CS130\Labs` folder
1. Create a folder called `CS130` on you `M:` drive

1. Create a folder called `Labs` inside of your `CS130` folder

## Mapping the `N:` network drive
1. Click the Windows *Start* button, in the bottom left corner of your screen

1. Open the File Explorer

1. Right click *This PC* in the pane on the right of the popup menu

1. Choose *Map network drive*

1. For Drive, choose the letter `N`

1. For Folder, type in the following server name: `\\ad\compsci$`

1. Make sure *Reconnect at logon* is checked

1. Click *Finish*

## Get a copy of this lab folder from the N: network drive

1. Go to folder `N:\Classes\CS130\labs` and copy and paste the folder for
   today’s lab (i.e., Lab03) to `M:\CS130\labs`

1. You may now work locally by opening the write-up from within the copied
   folder. (The write-up is the current document you are reading.)

1. For future labs, you may start by copying the proper lab folder right away.

## Introducing yourself
Create a Microsoft Word document describing yourself. Include in your
description, your name, where you are from, your major, your other interests,
any computer experience you have had (including programming, using spreadsheets
or databases), your reason for taking this class, any particular hopes or
expectations you might have for this class, and anything else you would like to
share about yourself. Boldface and center your name in 16-pt font. (Use any type
font). Save this file as aboutYourFirstNameYourLastName, (i.e. aboutJohnMiller),
in your lab folder. 

Insert a picture of yourself into the document aboutYou by completing the
following steps:

* Get a copy of a picture of you and place it in your lab folder. 
* Position cursor where picture is to be inserted in your document.
* From the menu bar, select **Insert---Picture** and then locate your image and
  click **Insert**.
* Save your document. (**File---Save** (file already exists)).

### Use the Mail Program to Submit the “aboutYou” file
It is assumed that everyone has used the mail program at some time. If you do
not know how to get into your mail program, ask your TA or Lab Instructor.
Follow the instructions below to send your file to your lecture professor and
also to your lab instructor.

### To insert a file into a mail message

* In the message area, position the insertion point where you want to insert the
  file
* From the Menu bar, select **Insert—Attach File**.
* Locate the file you want to insert. 
* Click on the file name and **Insert**. An icon and filename should appear in
  the message area.
* Repeat the steps above to send multiple files.
* Then click **Send** to complete the task.

## Scheduling meetings

CSB/SJU has made a decision to use the family of products known as Microsoft
Office. Among them is an application for sending/receiving email called
Microsoft Outlook. Besides email, Outlook is also capable of managing the
digital calendar associated with your CSB/SJU email account. One of the useful
functionalities that this provides is the ability to easily schedule meetings
with other users within the CSB/SJU network. Your task is to schedule a
10-minute meeting with me before the first exam (this is a real meeting that you
will be expected to come to, not just a fictitious one for the sake of this
assignment, so plan accordingly). To do this, you should complete the following
steps:

* Open the Microsoft Outlook application.
* Under the **Home** ribbon, click **New Items**.
* Under the **New Items** menu, click **Meeting**.

The following steps are similar to what you would do if you were sending an
email, except that there is a "Meeting time" associated with the message.

* Insert your classroom instructor’s (i.e., Jeremy’s) email address in the "To"
  field.
* For "Subject" put "[CSCI 130] Your Name Lab 1 meeting", i.e. if my name was
  John Doe, it would be "[CSCI 130] John Doe Lab 1 meeting". This would be a
  good time to look at details for sending emails to your instructor contained
  in the syllabus on the Canvas webpage.
* Choose a start time, i.e., when the meeting will start, that you and your
  instructor  are BOTH available, you can view your instructor’s prior
  commitments by clicking **Scheduling Assistant** in the **Meeting** ribbon ---
  to return to the appointment, click **Appointment** in the **Meeting** ribbon.
* Choose an end time that is 10 minutes after your start time.
* When all of the information is correct, click **Send** --- this will send an
  appointment invitation to your instructor which they can then accept, decline,
  or propose a new time.

* * *

The rest of the exercises for this lab are going to be done in room PE204 where
you will create programs to direct an **NXT Lego Mindstorms** robot. If you are
finished sending the file about yourself to your lecture and lab instructors,
log off and head down to room PE204 to start the Robotics exercise for this lab.
