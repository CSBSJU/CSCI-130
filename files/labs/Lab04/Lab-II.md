# Password crack calculator

**Disclaimer.** The program that you develop for this exercise should **NOT** be
considered a measure of the strength of a particular password. An obvious
example would be the password '*P@ssw0rd*', which, according to the program,
would take 147.53338 centuries to crack, but in practice would be among the
first passwords checked by any cracker worth their salt.

3. Use **File Explorer** to navigate to the folder containing the final version
   of your program `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part2` in your lab folder. Copy and
   paste this program in the same folder, and then right-click on the copy to
   rename it as `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part3`. Launch VS Express and use it to
   open the program `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part3`.

   Now, let's address test8 and test9.

   \BEGIN{Warning}
   Your program should behave identically to the solution which can be run by
   double-clicking the file `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part3.exe` found in the
   `Executables` folder inside of your lab folder.

   When done, save and close program `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part3`.
   \END{Warning}

   \BEGIN{Rubric}
   Checkpoint 5 (80/100): A successful `PasswordCrackCalulator_Part3` program:

   * produces correct results for all test cases except test9
   * must also have successfully completed Checkpoint 2

1. Use **File Explorer** to navigate to the folder containing the final version
   of your program `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part3` in your lab folder. Copy and
   paste this program in the same folder, and then right-click on the copy to
   rename it as `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part4`. Launch VS Express and use it to
   open the program `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part4`.

   Enhance your program so that along with all previous information it now also
   calculates and outputs the total number of seconds required to check the
   entire search space. The number of checks per second that the computer is
   able to do is a value that is input by the user. Be sure to include the units
   (seconds) in your output statement.

   Checkpoint 6 (85/100): A successful `PasswordCrackCalulator_Part4` program:

   * output the correct amount of time to check the search space
   * must also have successfully completed Checkpoint 2

1. Use **File Explorer** to navigate to the folder containing the final version
   of your program `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part4` in your lab folder. Copy and
   paste this program in the same folder, and then right-click on the copy to
   rename it as `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part5`. Launch VS Express and use it to
   open the program `PasswordCrackCalculator_Part5`.

   To make your program more user friendly, it should present the time to search
   using the most appropriate unit of measurement from the following list:

   * seconds,
   * minutes,
   * hours,
   * days,
   * weeks,
   * years, or
   * centuries.

   For example, if the number of seconds to search the space is less than 60, it
   should use the unit *seconds*, however if it is greater than 60, but less
   than 60&times;60=3600, then it should use the unit *minutes* and so on, all
   the way up to *centuries*. To keep things consistent, we will define a year
   as 52 weeks.

   **Submission Instructions**

   Your `M:\CS130\Labs\Lab04_YourLastName_YourFirstName` folder should contain
   your solutions to this and Tuesday's lab.

   To submit your work, copy this folder and paste it to
   `N:/Handins/CS130/Lab04` PRIOR to the end of lab today. Late submissions
   wonâ€™t be accepted and will receive a grade of 0 instead.
