# Password crack calculator

**Disclaimer.** The program that you develop for this exercise should **NOT** be
considered a measure of the strength of a particular password. An obvious
example would be the password '*P@ssw0rd*', which, according to the program,
would take 147.53338 centuries to crack, but in practice would be among the
first passwords checked by any cracker worth their salt.

3. Use **File Explorer** to navigate to the folder containing the final version
   of your program `PasswordCracking_Part2` in your lab folder. Copy and paste
   this program in the same folder, and then right-click on the copy to rename
   it as `PasswordCracking_Part3`. Launch VS Express and use it to open the
   program `PasswordCracking_Part3`.

   Now, let's address the error caused by inputting the password
   `"aA1@@@"`. Hopefully, you discovered that the correct search
   space for this password is 100,343,116,692. Unfortunately, this falls outside
   of the range of values that can be represented using the `Integer` data type,
   which is -2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647. Fix your program so that it
   handles passwords whose search space is larger than 2,147,116,692 by changing
   the declaration of your `searchSpace` variable to a more appropriate data
   type.

   \BEGIN{Warning}
   Your program should behave identically to the solution which can be run by
   double-clicking the file `PasswordCracking_Part3.exe` found in the
   `Executables` folder inside of your lab folder.

   When done, save and close program `PasswordCracking_Part3`.
   \END{Warning}

   \BEGIN{Rubric}
   Checkpoint 5 (80/100): A successful `PasswordCracking_Part3` program:

   * produces correct output for all test cases in Test Table 2
   * must also have successfully completed Checkpoint 2

1. Use **File Explorer** to navigate to the folder containing the final version
   of your program `PasswordCracking_Part3` in your lab folder. Copy and paste
   this program in the same folder, and then right-click on the copy to rename
   it as `PasswordCracking_Part4`. Launch VS Express and use it to open the
   program `PasswordCracking_Part4`.

   Enhance your program so that along with all previous information it now also
   calculates and outputs the total number of seconds required to check the
   entire search space. The number of checks per second that the computer is
   able to do is a value that is input by the user. Be sure to include the units
   (seconds) in your output statement.

   Here are some benchmarks of what computers are capable of. A computer
   guessing a password online using a web app hitting a target site is capable
   of approximately one thousand guesses per second. A high-powered server
   guessing a password offline is capable of approximately one billion guesses
   per second. And a massively parallel multiprocessing clusters or grid
   guessing a password offline is capable of approximately one trillion guesses
   per second.

1. Use **File Explorer** to navigate to the folder containing the final version
   of your program `PasswordCracking_Part4` in your lab folder. Copy and paste
   this program in the same folder, and then right-click on the copy to rename
   it as `PasswordCracking_Part5`. Launch VS Express and use it to open the
   program `PasswordCracking_Part5`.

   One of the most important tasks when developing a piece of software that
   depends on user input for calculations is to *validate* the user's input.
   *Validating input* involves checking the value input by the user to make sure
   that it conforms to any requirements of your program.

   For our password crack calculator, this requirement is that the password
   string contains only values from the following character types:

   * lower-case letters [a-z],
   * upper-case letters [A-Z],
   * digits [0-9], and
   * special characters [\^$/%@#].

   Enhance your program so that if the password input by the user includes any
   characters not listed in the types above, then an error message is displayed
   to the user and the program DOES NOT compute any of the values that it would
   otherwise. In other words, the button action returns immediately, without
   doing any computation. To display the error message, you should use a
   *MessageBox*.

   To find out if a
   [`String`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/data-types/string-data-type)
   contains a character that does not belong to a set of characters, you can
   also use the
   [`Like`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/like-operator)
   operator. For example, to check if the `String` variable `passwd` contains
   any characters that are not vowels and display a MessageBox and end the
   button action if it does, you would use the following Visual Basic code:

   ```vbnet
   If passwd Like "*[!aeiou]*" Then
       MessageBox.Show("The password " & passwd & " contains a non-vowel character")
       Return
   End If
   ```

   The `!` at the beginning of the set of characters in brackets `[` `]`
   indicates to look for characters not in the set `aeiou`.

   double-clicking the file `PasswordCracking_Part5.exe` found in the
   `Executables` folder inside of your lab folder.

   When done, save and close program `PasswordCracking_Part5`.
   \END{Warning}

   \BEGIN{Rubric}
   Checkpoint 7 (90/100): A successful `PasswordCracking_Part5` program:

   * handles invalid input (passwords that contain characters not allowed), by
     output a meaningful error message
   * must also have successfully completed Checkpoint 6

   program `PasswordCracking_Part6`.

   To make your program more user friendly, it should present the time to search
   using the most appropriate unit of measurement from the following list:

   * seconds,
   * minutes,
   * hours,
   * days,
   * weeks,
   * years, or
   * centuries.

   For example, if the number of seconds to search the space is less than 60, it
   should use the unit *seconds*, however if it is greater than 60, but less
   than 60&times;60=3600, then it should use the unit *minutes* and so on, all
   the way up to *centuries*. To keep things consistent, we will define a year
   as 52 weeks.
