### Processor design and assembly & machine languages
* SimHymnâ€™s processor design: CPU registers, memory addressing, and instruction
  format
  * Trace the execution of a program using the fetch-decode-increment-execute
    cycle showing the effects on CPU registers (von Neumann architecture)
* Translate a given VBA-like program to assembly language
* Find output for a given machine and/or assembly language program

### Data representation of integers
* Convert from ANY base to base 10
* Convert between base 10 integers and signed/unsigned binary integers
* Signed number representations: Two's complement
  * Advantages and limitations
  * Binary addition works &mdash; overflow and carry
* Convert between binary and hexadecimal

### Data representation of real numbers
* Decimal scientific and binary scientific notation
* Floating-point representation (sign, exponent and mantissa)
  * Convert between floating-point numbers and base 10
  * Advantages and limitations
