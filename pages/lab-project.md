title: "Lab project"

## TL;DR
You are to design and complete a Visual Basic programming project of your choice
in groups of two. The project should not be trivially small and should include
some computational significance. You are encouraged to use any or all Visual
Basic techniques you have learned so far and may use other techniques which you
have discovered.

<br/>
## Deliverables
Items in the [Instructions](#instructions) section denoted by the {% icon rubric
%} icon are considered *deliverables*. These are items for which you will need
to produce some artifact that is turned in and evaluated. A checklist of these
items is found below, along with due-dates; make sure to consult this often.

<!--
CHECKPOINT PROGRESS SCHEDULE: By February 24th — Each project group/individual
must send the instructor an email containing a rough outline of your project.
You are encouraged to come up with your own topic so that you have some interest
in the topic. If done in a group only one member of the group needs to email me.

By March 3rd and March 17th — Each project group/individual must send your
instructor a short progress report including a list of tasks completed and tasks
remaining, bumps in the road, areas of concern, etc.

By March 27th — Each project must be submitted for evaluation before class.

These progress reports are REQUIRED from every project team — they do not need
to be detailed, just a quick email will suffice.
-->

<br/>
## Scholastic conduct
See the [course syllabus](../assignments/syllabus#scholastic-conduct) for
expectations.

<!--
VERY IMPORTANT: It is assumed&mdash;IN GOOD FAITH&mdash;that ALL of the group
members WILL BE INVOLVED IN ALL ASPECTS/PHASES of the project (i.e. all must do
coding, document writing, etc&hellip; as opposed to one doing the coding and the
other one doing the writing) Each group member will be asked to evaluate the
contributions of your group partners and yourself.
-->

<br/>
## Instructions

### {% icon rubric %} Topic proposal
You first task for your Visual Basic project is to come up with a *topic
proposal*. This proposal will be reviewed by your lab instructor and feedback
will be provided. Your topic proposal should include three ideas for different
Visual Basic programs, or variations of a single program. The ideas may be based
on anything of interest to you&mdash;consider program(s) connected with your
major, a club, an activity of which you are a part, a student job, or hobby you
are interested in. The three ideas should have, in your best estimation, the
following achievability levels:

reach
: describe a program that you and your partner *would love* to create, but are
  not sure that you have the necessary background / time to complete.

<br/>
realistic
: describe a program that you and your partner *believe* that you would be able
  to implement in the time allotted for this project.

<br/>
safe
: describe a program that you and your partner *are certain* that you would be
  able to implement in the time allotted for this project.

Along with a brief description of each of the ideas, please write a sentence or
two about how the program will improve / enhance the current situation for its
intended audience.

You should bring a hard-copy (read: printed) of your topic proposal to lab on
the due date indicated above.

### {% icon rubric %} Statement of work
After meeting with your lab instructor during the *Project Introduction* lab,
you will need to produce a *statement of work (SOW)*. This brief document will
be a high-level overview of the work that your group will do and when you will
do it. It will include the following two sections:

Scope of work
: This is a revised version of your *topic proposal* based on the topic that was
  agreed upon with your lab instructor, and that incorporates any comments /
  concerns raised by your lab instructor.

<br/>
Preliminary schedule
: Here you should create a plan for how you will complete the work that you
  outlined in your *Scope of work*. Set out a plan for when you will be able to
  meet as a group, outside of the scheduled lab times. In addition, you should
  create a preliminary schedule for when you would like to have different parts
  of your project completed. This can be changed throughout the lifetime of the
  project, but should give you some incentive to get started sooner rather than
  later.

You should submit a soft-copy (read: computer file) to the `handins` folder by
midnight on the due date indicated above.

### {% icon rubric %} Project report

#### Features
The project should incorporate features from the following set of Visual Basic
features:

* If then-else statement
* File input
* File output
* Arrays and processing each element in some way
* Arrays and searching
* Arrays and sorting
* Extensive use of colors
* Extensive use of pictures / images
* Input from text boxes
* Input from input boxes
* Loops, (Do While or For Next)
* String functions (e.g. Left, Right, Contains, Substring, etc &hellip;)
* Math functions (e.g. Sqrt, Round, Abs, Int, etc &hellip;)
* Message boxes
* Additional features not covered in class (such as the following)
  * Custom Functions
  * Multiple forms
  * Form Level Variables
  * Module Variables
  * Dynamic picture loading
  * Select Case statements
  * Do Until Loop / Do Loop Until loops
  * Other objects from the VB toolbox (e.g. option buttons)
  * Other features that you've discovered on your own

### {% icon rubric %} Demo
Each group should plan about 3&ndash;5 minutes for a quick demonstration of
their project to the class on the due date. It is expected that all members of
the group participate somehow. Some items to include in your demo:

* An overview of the topic you chose (why it interests you, why you considered
  it over other topics, etc)
* How you approached the problem — what planning did you do before coding
* An overview of the project's operation
* Any significant hurdles you overcame
* Frustrations, moments of clarity, etc.

In addition, you should be prepared to indicate to the instructor how many of
the features that your program incorporates, as well as show samples of each
such feature in your program.

<br/>
## Grading criteria
For a project to earn a B: Your code must work correctly, and both your code and
your written report must meet the requirements explained later. Your program
must use a minimum of 10 features from the list of features listed above. Your
program must have a reasonable and understandable interface, especially for any
required user input.

For a project to earn an A:  It must meet all the requirements of a B project,
use a minimum of 12 features from the list above, AND meaningfully include at
least one interesting feature not covered in class from list above.

The *Project Features* section of your project report will be used to determine
which criteria are met&mdash;therefore you should make sure you list your
features accurately.

QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF WHEN DONE:

* Project report quality
  * Does the project report have a clear introduction that explains the project?
  * Have you adequately described your experiences in doing this project?
  * Did you describe in detail and with support the features you used in the
    project
* Internal code quality
  * Have you given good names for objects and variables?
  * Is the code indented properly?
  * Does the code include appropriate and useful comments?
  * Is the style of coding consistent?
  * Are there comment headers to describe the action of each button?
* User interface
  * Is the form layout well designed? (sensible/logical)
  * Is the purpose of the project clearly identified on the opening form?
  * Are the directions/button-labels clear on how to proceed?
  * Is the sequencing of options for the user appropriate? (Can I press the
    wrong button?)
  * Is the output formatted, meaningful, and easy to read?
  * Is the user ever left guessing what just happened?
* Quality of project
  * Is the problem the project addressed challenging?
  * Is the project creative?
  * Does the program adequately address the problem?
  * Does it work correctly?

## Submission
On the due date, submit a soft copy of your project report and your project
itself in a single zip archive. A template for you project report can be found
here.

All files for your project, including your report, should be placed in a single
folder named Lastname1Lastname2VBProject. To turn in your project, you will copy
and paste this folder into the N:\Handins\CS130 folder.

OTHER IMPORTANT COMMENTS: If you use data files or picture/image files in your
code, put them in the Bin/Debug folder of your project.-->
